OVERVIEW
--------

This small module provides a possibility to "reject" comment by adding a
"reject" link. 


SETTING UP
----------
Just install a module and "reject" link will appear in comment links ( in a
row with 'delete', 'edit', approve' etc.).

DEPENDENCIES
------------
This module is build on Drupal Core module Comment, that's why Comment module
should be enabled.

TO-DO:
1) Would be great to add Views Support.
2) Theme rejected comments to have another color when viewing by admin.
